Configuration
=============
For this application, there is only one important cofiguration which relates to database configuration.
You can do database configuration in project_root/ahrm/settings.py



Database Initialization
=======================
If you do not have yet database, you can goto project_root/ahrm
And run the following Django command line: 
    python manage.py syncdb

This command line will create data base schema and sample data.
It will also ask you to create a super user. This user will be used to login our application. 
 
 
Deployment
==========
Compiling messages for multi-languages, go to project_root/ahrm run the following django command line:
    django-admin.py compilemessages
go to project_root/ahrm, and run the following django command line:
    python manage.py runserver [host:port]

If we do not specific host and port, it will listen to only the default url http://localhost:8000,
otherwide, it will listen to url http://host:port
or you can do the quick deployment by running the following file:
   Windows  --> run file run.bat
   Linux --> run file run.sh
   
For more about files run.(bat or sh)  you can change host name or port number by editing directly this run file.

To run application, you just use the above url to run with web browser.
